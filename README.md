# Real-Time-Facial-Recognition-with-Smart-Auto-Attendanse-System

Real Time Facial Recognition with Smart Auto Attendanse System based on:-

Python , Machine Learning , Deep Learning , Computer vision, Sql workbench , HTML , Tkinter , MS Excel.

Algorithm Use:

1.Haarcascade Opencv (Object Detection)

2.LBPH Opencv (Face Recognition)


1.The Smart Attendance System Using Face Recognition is a software application that automates attendance-taking using facial recognition technology. It eliminates the need for manual attendance-taking, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. This system enables the recognition of a person's identity using a camera and compares it with the database to record attendance.


2.This software can automatically take attendance using facial recognition technology. The system will use a camera to capture the face of each person and match it with the database to identify them. The system will store attendance records for each person in an Excel file and generates a report.


3.The system uses state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning algorithms to recognize individuals accurately and mark their attendance in real time.
This eliminates the need for manual attendance management, which is prone to errors and can be time-consuming.


Here are Realtime Detection Shots.

The system will use a facial recognition algorithm to recognize faces. The algorithm should be able to detect faces and extract facial features accurately.
